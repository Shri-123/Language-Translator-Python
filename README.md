# Language-Translator-Python
I have developed a language translator using Python that converts voice input into the desired language. The project's primary objective is to enable the conversion of any language into another chosen language. By utilizing Python technology and leveraging relevant libraries and modules, the application provides a user-friendly interface.

Upon launching the application, users are presented with a list of available languages for translation. They are then prompted to enter the code representing the input language they will be speaking in. (The code system is used for simplicity, as provided by the Googletrans library.) Next, users are asked to input the code for the desired output language. Once these initial steps are completed, users can begin speaking in the input language.

The system effectively captures the spoken language, detecting and storing the voice input. Subsequently, the stored input is translated into the desired output language. The application displays both the spoken text and the translated text in written format. Additionally, users can listen to the translated voice output through an accompanying .mp3 file.

This project provides a software-based, uninterrupted, and versatile multilanguage translation solution, eliminating the need for external translators. The system effectively handles text and speech-related challenges, ensuring seamless translation processes.
