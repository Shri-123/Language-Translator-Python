# Language-Translator-Python
I have tried to make a language translator using python which basically translates voice input into desired language.

The main aim of my project is to convert any language into any desired language.
By using python technology and using various functions from the libraries or modules mentioned firstly  
after running the application it firstly displays the various languages available for  translation. 
After this the system asks user to input the code of the language which he/she is going to give the input in the voice format 
.(As googletrans is going to provide code of the languages instead of whole language spelling.), 
then the user is asked to enter the output language code in which the translated language is going to be displayed. 
Now, the user has to speak in the language which is given as an input language.
Now the system is going to detect the voice and the language words and finally stores the voice.
Then it converts the stored language input into the desired language output and finally it will display the text format of both the languages 
which we have spoken and the translated text.Along with this, the voice output is also heard by the user shown in the translated text, 
by playing the .mp3 file formed of the translated voice output. In this way, the whole translation process takes place.  

 In this project, no external translator is required because it is providing the software based multilanguage translation facility 
 with none interruption of human or anything. Only machine will work as part of the system and it's the sole one which can handle all the problems 
 associated with the text and speech.
